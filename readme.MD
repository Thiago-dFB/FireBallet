## ABOUT THE GAME

OS: Windows 8/10/11

### Controls
- WASD: movement
- Left mouse button: fire
- Spacebar: dash

### Game rules
- Score by defeating enemies that spawn constantly and at an increasing rate.
- Play area is limited by a shrinking ring outside of which you (but not the enemies) take constant damage.
- Enemies that hit each other can start in-fighting.

## CHALLENGES AND CONSIDERATIONS

- This game was made as team college project back in 2018, but I was responsible for over 90% of the code.
- Gameplay was greatly inspired by Doom Classic/1993, which shows in features such as:
    - deliberately slippery movement, making your position and direction of motion conscious decisions
    - enemy in-fighting
- Other influences include battle royales, that were at the peak of their popularity back then, and the then-announced Doom Eternal, which introduced a dash to the series' gameplay.
- Due to GameMaker's strange commercial model at the time and the rest of the team only having trial licenses, they could not open the project and contribute if it passed a certain number of classes and scripts.
- This greatly hampered the game's scope, which had other weapons and enemy types planned and partially implemented that weren't shown in the final presentation, and then I couldn't find it within me to develop it much further, having struggled a lot with some design decisions on GameMaker's part that catered to begginer developers.

## ABOUT THE PROJECT

- This project was made in GameMaker Studio 2.2.4, and has issues opening in newer versions of the software. I'm not entirely sure by which means this version is still attainable.
- The only third-party script present is located at "FireBallet\scripts\ray_cast\ray_cast.gml", which was sourced from here: https://marketplace.gamemaker.io/assets/5161/raycast
